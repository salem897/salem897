### Hi there 👋

I am Montalvo. I´m currently studying High School, and I really like programming, I start learning it a couple of year ago and I have had a lot of funny time in this time :).
- I’m currently learning to use Python, so I´m very excited about it.
- I have compited in mecatronic contests doing Zumo Cars with the help of Arduino.
- My favorite animal are the turtles, I have a little one at home.🐢
